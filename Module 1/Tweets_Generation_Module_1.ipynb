            "\n",
            "1. **Input Embeddings and Positional Encoding**:\n",
            "    - **Input Embeddings**: Words (or tokens) are converted into vectors of fixed size using embedding layers.\n",
            "    - **Positional Encoding**: Since transformers do not have a built-in sense of sequence order (unlike RNNs), positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to provide information about the position of each token in the sequence.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Encoder**:\n",
            "    The encoder is composed of a stack of identical layers, each containing two main sub-layers:\n",
            "    - **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Allows each position in the input sequence to attend to all other positions, computing a weighted sum of these positions. The self-attention mechanism is defined by the `Scaled Dot-Product Attention` and involves queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V).\n",
            "    - **Feed-Forward Neural Network**: A position-wise fully connected feed-forward network that is applied independently to each position.\n",
            "\n",
            "    Each of these sub-layers is followed by a layer normalization step and a residual connection.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Decoder**:\n",
            "    Similar to the encoder, the decoder is also composed of a stack of identical layers, but with an additional sub-layer in each layer:\n",
            "    - **Masked Self-Attention Mechanism**: This prevents attending to future positions in the sequence during training, which is useful for tasks like text generation.\n",
            "    - **Encoder-Decoder Attention Mechanism**: Allows the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence by attending to the output of the encoder.\n",

            "\n",

            "1. **Calculating Query, Key, and Value Matrices**: These are linear transformations of the input embeddings.\n",
            "2. **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: The attention scores are computed as the dot product of the query and key matrices, scaled by the square root of the dimension of the key vectors. These scores are then passed through a softmax function to obtain the attention weights.\n",
            "3. **Weighted Sum**: The final output is a weighted sum of the value vectors, using the attention weights.\n",

            "\n",
            "Instead of performing a single self-attention operation, transformers use multiple self-attention \"heads\" in parallel. Each head operates in a different subspace of the input, and their outputs are concatenated and linearly transformed to produce the final result.
